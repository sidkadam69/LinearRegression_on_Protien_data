# F3 - Fractional area of exposed non polar residue. 
# F4 - Fractional area of exposed non polar part of residue. 
# F5 - Molecular mass weighted exposed area. 
# F6 - Average deviation from standard exposed area of residue. 
# F7 - Euclidian distance. 
# F8 - Secondary structure penalty. 
# F9 - Spacial Distribution constraints (N,K Value).
